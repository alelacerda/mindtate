 # **Mindtate**
 
*To meditate* is to pay attention to the breath while noticing where the mind wanders off.
 
This is an ancient pratice that allows us to learn to **stay in the present** and to **recognize our thoughts** and accept them, without any judgements. It also **reduces stress**, **helps us understand our pains** and **improves our focus**.
 
 This playground is an *interactive experience* for those who want to start experimenting with this technique.

 ## Breathing
 
 **Paying attention to our breathing is the most essential part of a meditation pratice.** It *anchors* ourselves in the present and makes us notice and connect to our whole bodies and minds.
 
 Simply *breathe in* slowly through your nose and *breathe out* slowly through your mouth, trying to maintain a calm pace.
 
 
 ---
 
 ## Labeling Thoughts
 
If you notice your mind has wandered, **don't panic**. Simply notice your thoughts, recognize them, label them, and let them go, returning your attention to  your breath.
 

 - Note: There's no right or wrong when it comes to labeling your thoughts. *It's up for you to decide which label goes with which thought.*
 
 
 ---
 
 ## Closing your pratice
 
 When you decide you're ready to stop, take a moment to notice your surroundings, notice how your body feels, notice your emotions. **Do it gently and don't rush.**
 
 
 **And that's it!** Hopefully you will feel much calmer and relaxed by the end, and with each pratice the process of meditating will become easier everytime.
